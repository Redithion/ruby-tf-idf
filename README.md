    corpus = 
    [
    'A big enough hammer can usually fix anything',

    'A bird in the hand is better than one overhead!',

    'A cynic smells flowers and looks for the casket.'
    ]

    limit = 3 #restrict to the top 3 relevant words per document
    exclude_stop_words = false

    @t = RubyTfIdf::TfIdf.new(corpus,limit,exclude_stop_words)
    output =  @t.tf_idf
